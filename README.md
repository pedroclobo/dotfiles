# Dotfiles
This is the git repository I use to manage my dotfiles.

## Deploy my dotfiles
In order to deploy my dotfiles, I use a script that creates a link for every file, so I can keep track of file versions through one simple git repository. <br>
To deploy the dotfiles just run the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pedroclobo/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
